# PRODIGY_DS_01
Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.

## Gender Employment Distribution Analysis

This Python code analyzes and visualizes the distribution of employment status and recruitment source by gender using a stacked bar plot. It's a valuable tool for exploring categorical data and understanding how different factors contribute to employment patterns.  The code reads a dataset containing information about gender, employment status, and recruitment sources. It groups the data by gender, employment status, and recruitment source and creates a stacked bar plot to visualize the distribution. The x-axis represents gender and employment status. The y-axis represents the count. Different colors represent different recruitment sources. The legend shows the mapping of recruitment sources to colors.
